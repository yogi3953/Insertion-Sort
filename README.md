# Insertion-Sort
Insertion Sort is a simple and efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm that works similarly to sorting playing cards in your hand.

# How It Works
Assume the first element is already sorted.
Pick the next element and compare it with the elements before it.
Shift the larger elements one position to the right to make space.
Insert the current element into its correct position.
Repeat for all elements until the array is sorted.
